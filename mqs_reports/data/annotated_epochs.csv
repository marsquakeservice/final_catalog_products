A disturbance at 2019-03-09,14:17 required a second look. High frequency impulse followed by ~20 seconds oscillations including vertical; not obviously correlated with pressure. Does not look like a Rayleigh wave.

MvD:
double checked: we do see a correlation with pressure (02.MDO and 50.VDO)."

MvD: it's true that the envelope looks a bit unusual and the timing with UHF is concerning. However, I don't think we have ever seen a UHF pass create such a signal on the seismic data. Added it as a 2.4D to the catalogue."
